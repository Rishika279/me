TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Exercise 0: Went okay. I learnt that numbers have to be changed by str() to act as strings instead of integers.  
Exercise 1: Gave me more confidence with reading and understanding code.
Exercise 2: print(hero) prints 'MC Hammer'. I learnt how to interpret error messages to edit code.
Exercise 3: I found it very difficult and am still trying to wrap my head around for loops.
