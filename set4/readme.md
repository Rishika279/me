TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Set 3 Exercise 3 from last week: learned that the error was in my indenting as well as not using a break in my while loop for when the condition was met. Alternatively, using while = false.

Set 4 Exercise 1: I think I understand opening, reading and writing files well.
wordy_pyramid and pokedex were difficult functions to write. I think my code for pokedex could be more efficient.
