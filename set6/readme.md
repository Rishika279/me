TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Flexi-week!
I used this week to make sure all my exercises for Sets 1-4 passed their tests and were committed and pushed to GitHub.
I also finalised on a dataset topic. I decided to go with Disaster Event data in and around Australia. I believe the results could be interesting because such events are often uncontrollable and unexpected. This data also includes geographical data that can be mapped.
