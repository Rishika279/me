TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I began to analyse my data using GeoPandas.
With my original Disaster Event database, the spreadsheet lacked precise locations or coordinates and also contained one top many layout errors that interfered with Pandas.
Therefore, I made the decision to switch to a second database that included the same disaster events but only up until 2014. However, it makes up for this by having an abundance of interesting information as well as the exact coordinates for every event to map the data.
