TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I researched some datasets to use for my upcoming data project. I found it difficult to find data of interest that would have enough information (i.e. 200+ rows) to analyse as well as geographical data.
Some of the topics I looked into included crime statistics, COVID cases during the pandemic, student HECS-HELP debts, news headlines.
I also worked on and updated Set 4 so that all the tests pass.
